Who we are

Maersk is well established as the world’s largest operator of container shipping and marine container terminals, with over 80,000 employees and operating in 130 countries worldwide.

We are rapidly transforming ourselves into the world’s leading global integrator of container logistics by building on our traditional strengths and creating synergies and simplifying global supply chains for our customers across ocean, terminals and logistics & services.

Technology and data are critical enablers of this digital transformation, as we seek to digitally enable and connect our physical supply chain assets in our terminals, our vessel fleet and inland logistics services through an ambitious agenda of standardisation, automation and IoT enablement.

In support of this strategy, we have recently restructured our global technology organisation to be based around a joint business and technology platform operating model, which embeds innovative, agile, digital and data product engineering at the heart of our business.

APM Terminals

Ownership. You feel ownership for everything you deliver. You'd never call code ""released"" until you're satisfied that it's well implemented and tested. You pride yourself on efficient monitoring, detailed documentation, and accurate test coverage.
Attention to details. Whether you're working on an API used by other developers, an internal tool consumed by our operation teams, or a feature used by millions of customers, your attention to details results in a delightful user experience.
A great teammate. You believe that you can achieve more on a team; that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. You rely on others candid feedback for continuous improvement. You can take the lead and have a phenomenal sense of what doing 'the right thing' is. You seek ways to mentor others and share your knowledge with the team.
