You should feel comfortable in uncharted territory as we build innovative privacy technologies and grow user trust. We need your skills and passion to help make it happen.

- Roles and Responsibilities -—
Design, develop, test, and deploy software solutions to address real world privacy concerns through close collaboration with various engineering and product teams, as well as many business and legal teams across Uber
Build microservices, backend platforms and collaborate with user experiences for Uber customers & partners, internal team members to enable automation of various privacy functions
Work closely in a big data environment and with large scale systems to handle user data lifecycle
Drive excellence by demonstrating and adopting best practices in engineering standards, and consumer privacy
Process extensive amount of data, build software solutions to enable data inventory, data deletion, data export and data preservation

Ability to learn on the go. You thrive with new technologies and don't believe in one-size-fits-all solutions. You can adapt to meet the needs of our massive scale, growth, and evolving business environment.
Ownership. You feel ownership for everything you deliver. You'd never call code ""released"" until you're satisfied that it's well implemented and tested. You pride yourself on efficient monitoring, detailed documentation, and accurate test coverage.
Attention to details. Whether you're working on an API used by other developers, an internal tool consumed by our operation teams, or a feature used by millions of customers, your attention to details results in a delightful user experience.
A great teammate. You believe that you can achieve more on a team; that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. You rely on others candid feedback for continuous improvement. You can take the lead and have a phenomenal sense of what doing 'the right thing' is. You seek ways to mentor others and share your knowledge with the team.
